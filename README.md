# Task 4: Sperm Segmentation (Semantic Segmentation)

The objective of this task is the identification of human sperm cells which we will count as a successful identification if the corresponding head, body, and tail of said cell is present. For this task we will be using convolutional based models (DeepLabV3), and building several experiments using different combinations of parameters. 

All tests, source code and data manipulation are inside the `.ipynb` in this repo, it is also available in this [Colab Notebook]().
